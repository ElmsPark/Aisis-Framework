	 *		We load the list of ALL posts here. This is your index.php
	 *		file essentially.
	 *
	 *		This file is loaded via the BuildAisisTheme file as
	 *		is loaded into a pluggable. This allows you to over
	 *		ride that function (which loads this file) in your custom
	 *		-functions.php Thus allowing you to change the way this page
	 *		looks by telling the function to load a different phtml file.
	 *
	 *		The same goal can be achieved in over writing this file
	 *		in a child theme or through Aisis Packages.
