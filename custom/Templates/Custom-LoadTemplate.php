	 *
	 *		Do you have a template in this file? Do you want to load
	 *		it into the core them its self? How do you do that?
	 *
	 *		Lets asume you have a theme template called index-loop.php:
	 *
	 *		Just write the following:
	 *
	 *	       function aisis_loop_index(){
	 *		   		get_template_part('/lib/custom/Templates/loop-index');
	 *	 	   }
	 *
	 *		This will over write the current function and write your own
	 *		theme templates.
