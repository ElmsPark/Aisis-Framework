=======
Aisis Theme Framework is a object oritented, clean, highly extendable framework for WordPress developers, designers and regular users of all levels.

Aisis Theme Framework is built on the revolutionary [AisisCore](https://github.com/AdamKyle/Aisis-Core/tree/development) which is still in **beta**.

Aisis Theme Framework is the most stable, most beautifully written, well documented peice of “Software” that sits on top of WordPress, the open source market has to offer. Themes like Thesis, Headway and other wish they could be Aisis.

What Makes Aisis Beter?
------------------------------

We have take the time to implement featurs such as **Twitter Bootstrap**, **AisisCore**, **Cleaner Admin Options** and a better **Loop API** (Provided by AisisCore).

Aisis Theme Framework is truly a revolutionary theme that other themes wish they could be or imitate.

Child Themes?
------------------

There is full support for [child themes](https://github.com/AdamKyle/Aisis-ChildTheme) and we have also released 1.0 of the [Aisis Core Theme](https://github.com/AdamKyle/AisisCore-Theme), which is a slim down, lightweight, to the point blogging theme styled after bootstraps blog.

Child themes can use the AisisCore Autoloader class to talk to the parent theme classes and extend as well as implement them!

AisisCore?
----------

AisisCore is thezend like framework behind the theme framework it's self. We have built an object oriented Array based approach to building themes, plugins and products that sit on top of and use WordPress API's.

AisisCore is well documented both in [User Manual](https://aisiscore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) sense and [API Documentation](http://adamkyle.github.io/Aisis-Core/Documentation/index.html).

**Note:** AisisCore is still in development. While stable enough for use with in the theme it's self, we consider the framework to be beta.

Object Oriented Approach
------------------------

Theme today are a mess of html, php and logic all over the place. When designing Aisis Theme Framework, we wanted to create something dynamic, something that was clean, modularized, decoupled and easy to maintain and enhance. With AisisCore we came to build Aisis Theme, which is exactly what we wanted: clean, modularized and object oriented.
