#Aisis Beta
--------------

Aisis Beta is at any one given time a beta, stable or not, of the current master branch. That is, when we are ready to push a new release it goes from the development branch to the beta to the master â€“ only when the beta is stable enough to be pushed.

#Bleeding Edge
-------------------

If you want the latest and greatest of Aisis I would take the devX.X version which you can find by clicking on the branch and going down to the latest. If you want the most up to date and stable version I would take the master version.

##Bleeding Edge For devX.X

If you are on the 1.x branch and you want the latest for the 1.1 series you can follow [twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AisisTheme&src=typd) to get the latest news or the [news](http://aisis.adambalan.com/category/news/) posts to make sure you always have the latest of that branch before we push updates out.

#Aisis Theme 1.2
----------------

Aisis Theme 1.2 is the the second iteration of Aisis Theme. This is currently in development. You can follow the [blog posts](http://aisis.adambalan.com/tag/1-2/) to find out more.

#Development Branch
-------------------

This branch is used to contain all the development code that is pushed from the individual devx.x branches to this branch before pushed
to beta and then master.

During the life cycle of a devx.x branch, changes will be made to it, pushed here and then to the beta branch before the 
master branch.

**Do not pull from this branch** pull from either the master or the appropriate devx.x branch.
