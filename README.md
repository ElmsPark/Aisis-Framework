#Aisis Development Branch

Aisis Development branch is the branch all the other dev branches get pushed too before they are pushed to beta. At any one time this code could be version 1.1.7 or 1.4 or 1.3. It all depends on the fixes and the pushing of stable code.

This means that when we think, for example, dev1.1 branch is ready we push it here. Test it on Aisis and associated sites and then push it out to beta for the public to use and then to master when officially ready.

We do not suggest you pull from or download anything from this branch as it is just a means to an end and a road on the way to beta. Any work that is done here or pushed to here is done such that we are making last minute changes.
