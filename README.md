#Development
------------

Much like the beta branch this branch is considered the development branch, that is, when a new or existing branch is ready to 
be released we use this branch to push that new branch to, before we go to beta. From here when the changes meet our satisfaction
we then push the changes to beta.

Do not pull from this branch, pull from the appropriate X.x branch
