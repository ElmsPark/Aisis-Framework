#[Aisis](http://aisis.adambalan.com/)
-------

Aisis is a highly sophisticated, modular and OOP based theme framework geared and designed towards developers of WordPress.

The core concept behind Aisis is to be neat, clean, fast and easy to use as a stand alone theme on either Multisite or on a non Multisite installation of WordPress.

Aisis is designed to aid developers in creating rich plugins, packages and child themes for the theme framework with out having to do a ton of work. We do the heavy lifting for you, while you leverage the power of the API's to produce beautiful and stunning work.

#How is Aisis Different?
-----------------------------

Aisis is designed with developers in mind that is, the framework is a series of easily expendable API's that can be used to build amazing and some what complicated and complex websites based off of Aisis it's self. This is accomplished through the use of Packages, Child Themes and Plugins.

##Child Themes

Aisis makes use of the child theme concept by giving you a function based file, [which you can read more about here](http://aisis.adambalan.com/ae/registering-templates-and-modules-in-aisis/), to which you can then use and build amazing child themes and even works in build packages and plugins.

##Plugins

Aisis currently does not have its own plugins, how ever all plugins should work with Aisis out of the box. Other things to note is that with the Aisis core function based file for building child themes and packages it will also work to build plugins as it will give you a way to hook into Aisis and leverage the powerful API with in.

##Packages

Packages are essentially just folders of assets, code and images that then change, create or manipulate Aisis in ways that change the way the core functionality works without making actual modifications to the code base it's self.

Packages can be dropped into the custom/packages folder and thus they will just run as created.
