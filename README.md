Aisis is a highly dynamic, beautiful, responsive and clean theme framework designed and developed for developers of child themes. Its core mission statement and goal is to:
Get the hell out of the way and let you do what you want to do. We are the developer’s wet dream in terms of ease of use, documentation and flexibility.

#Building a child theme with Aisis
----------------------------------

Is as easy as including the Aisis functions.php in to your child themes function.php, this gives you access to every Aisis function, class and API that’s out there. You won’t have to worry about doing:

```ruby
require_once(‘aisisfile’);
```

Instead if that file is not a class you just call its function, if that file is a class you can just instantiate the class and call its functions from there.
