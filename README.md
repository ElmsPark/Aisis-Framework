#Aisis 1.2 Development Branch
=========================

Aisis 1.2 development has been talked about extensively on the [blog]( http://aisis.adambalan.com/tag/aisis-1-2/). 
This has been some big news for a while. Aisis 1.2 used some new features like [AisisCore](http://labs.adambalan.com/aisis/aisis-core/) which is also hosted
on github, and [Twitter Boostrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) which is also a github project.
Aisis 1.2 is aimed to be more stable, more cleaned and more reliable than previous version of Aisis.

With Aisis, the goal is to change the way developers of themes for WordPress
think and react to the ever growing and ever evolving market of free, open source and paid themes.

**Note:** This is currently a unstable, in development mode product, if you would like to see the 
front end example of what’s being developed. Please see the [demo site](http://adambalan.com/WordPressDev/) – which is currently
always under development. We also call this the development site.

##Aisis 1.2 Development
====================

Aisis 1.2 is all about simplicity, ease of use and maintainability. It’s about being able to
add, remove, update and push a product that other developers and average users want to use with WordPress.

Aisis 1.2 is about OOP concepts, DI, FP and other patterns of development 
that help the product remain stable, clean and easy to implement, use, set
up and modify both front and back end.

##Aisis Documentation
===================

Currently Aisis 1.1.x has an [extensive documentation section on Aisis](http://aisis.adambalan.com/aisis-documentation/). With Aisi 1.2 we are switching 
that all to php docs that will be hosted for easy and quick access to the documentation.

**Note:** at this time we do not have documentation for the products Aisis Core or Aisis Theme because of 
the rapid changing that happens to Aisis Theme and Aisis Core. We will have a fully documented product by launch
of Beta for Aisis 1.2.
