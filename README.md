We take steps for developers and designers to make sure they have a clean and robust [API](http://aisis.adambalan.com/classes-api/) based system so that they can develop plugins, child themes and the newly noted [Packages.](http://aisis.adambalan.com/ae/packages-the-understanding-of/)

Aisis is also extremely easy to use as a theme; we lay out the options to you in very plain English and make it extremely easy for you to get right to blogging.

If you are a developer or a designer and you are looking to make child themes then this is also the theme framework for you – because it is extremely easy to manipulate and alter to fit your needs through our Extensive and well documented API.
